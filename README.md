Chebyshev approximants and Piecewise-Chebyshev approximants, written in pure numpy. The `ChebyshevApproximant` has significantly shorter overhead time than the version currently in numpy, but slightly slower execution time. As far as I know, there is no `PiecewiseChebyshevApproximant` in `numpy`.

The `ChebyshevApproximant` is mostly ported from `peri`, written by @briandleahy and @mattbierbaum
